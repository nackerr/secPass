# secPass
secPass is a 'secure' password manager based in PHP. The reason I say 'secure' is because it is only as secure as you make it. Currently, it has encrypted passwords for logging in that are not decryptable. And when storing your passwords for websites, each password is hashed with a specific key that is randomly generated and stored on our servers, only to be decrypted when logged in. 

# This is not meant to be the most secure thing, it is simply designed to show how security works and the different methods that can be used.
